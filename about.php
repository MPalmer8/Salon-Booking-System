  <div><p>Hello my name is Durgawati Nayak but everybody knows me as “Durga” or “Ms D”
  I can honestly say I do love what I do, being a beautician fills me with joy.
  I have been in this industry for 15 years, working in Stratford and Leyton hair & beauty salons.</p>
  <p>I would say East London is where I feel comfortable working the most, it’s where I’ve built my social contacts, and also where I lived when I first moved to the UK.
  After working for other people for so many years I felt it was time for a change so I decided to go it alone and set up shop somewhere new.
  Lush Hair & Beauty Studio in Lea Bridge Road in Leyton is my very first hair & beauty business. Many of my existing clients have been following me for over 9 
  years and are loyal because they say they love my friendly personality and easy going disposition.
  Being a beautician has allowed me to make new friends from different parts of the community.
  I am into food and love cooking when I have time. I am fussy when it comes to food and it has to smell and taste nice before I give it my approval. I do 
  sometimes share my cooking with my regular clients for them to try at home.</p>
  <p>Like most women I am into clothes and make-up. I also have a strong attraction to shoes! Running a busy salon has not left me with much time to travel, and 
  it’s something I would like to do more of in the near future with short breaks in Europe.
  I would describe my salon as family orientated, and I love working with different age groups, from children to much older members of the local community.
  Many of my clients are Asian, but I am proud to have a strong mix of clients from all cultural backgrounds. This helps my work become more fulfilling. I also have
  an increasing clientele of men coming into the salon which is good for business but also a nice change. I never turn anybody away unless it’s a service or
  treatment I don’t provide. Obviously I have some clients that adhere to strict religious customs and I can cater for their extra privacy if needed.
  Everybody is welcome to come into Lush Hair & Beauty Salon and go out looking good and feeling amazing. I love helping my clients look and feel their best and 
  look after their wellbeing. Customer service and satisfaction are two business values I adhere to very strictly, that’s why I have such loyal customers.</p></div>
